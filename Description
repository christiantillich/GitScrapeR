Description: Just some useful functions for managing a lot of github
    dependencies. Some tools to do regex search on repos, or lists of repos, tools
    for installing all repos under a given user, etc. At the core it's a hit to the
    Git API using curl, and just a bunch of R functions built on top of that.
